## About This Project

This project used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in union to create a full-function application with user interactivity. It combined all the knowledge earned in class so far to handle several different, simultaneous functions; all of which are interconnected.

This presents a unique challenge, as moving one string of code can have a cascading effect, unintentionally pulling apart other parts of the application.

## User Story

```

I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria
